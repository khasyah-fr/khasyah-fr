### Hi there 👋

My name is Fitra. I am interested in ways of problem-solving in many different domains. As of now,

- 🏛️  I graduated from Universitas Gadjah Mada, majoring in Computer Science. For my bachelor thesis, I utilized reinforcement learning to reduce energy waste on supercomputers. You can access the paper [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-29927-8_8).
- 🌱  I’m currently learning about backend engineering. I've worked on projects using PHP, Javascript, Python, and as of now I am using Golang. Other technologies I've worked with include: Git, Docker, MySQL, Postgre, Redis, gRPC. 
- 📌 Currently in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.
